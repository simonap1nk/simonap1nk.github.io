				<h1>SIMONA E SUCIU</h1> <h2>ABOUT ME: </h2>
			</header>
			<p>Hi, I'm Simona. I'm probably the older than everyone in this class, so that's great. Perks of starting college at 24, I guess. Anyway, I'm very goal oriented and driven for success at this point in my life. I'm sure none of you heard what I actually want to do with my CIS degree, based off of the the fact that one of you called me "Shih Tzu"... And to answer your question, no... you may not call me "shih tzu"...I go by Simona. (That was super disrespecful by the way...learn some manners, it may come in handy later on in your lives. It's really no way to treat a veteran.) Anyhoo... I'm not here to entertain or impress a group of children. I'm here to get an "A" in this class which gets me one step closer to graduating, getting  me closer to a BA carreer and making bank with my company.</p>
